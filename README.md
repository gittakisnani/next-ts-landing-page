1. Fork the project:
    - Click the gray `Fork` button in the top right of this page. This creates your copy of the project and saves it as a new repository in your github account
2. Create a New Branch:
    - On your new repository's page, click the gray 'master' button in the upper left to reveal a dropdown menu.
    - Enter the name of your new branch in the text box. (Branch names usually make a reference to what is being changed. Example: `nameAdd`).
3. Edit:
    - On the top right of the Readme file, click on the pencil icon to edit the file by adding your name.
    - After editing the Readme file, add a commit message and click on the green button saying "Commit Changes". Make sure you have selected the branch you have created.
4. Raise a Pull Request:
    - Click `Pull Requests` (which is the third option at the top of this page after the options `Code` and `Issues`).
    - Click the green `New Pull Request` button. This will prep the new pull request for you by autofilling the `base repository`: base with 'next-ts-landing-page: main' AND autofilling your `head repository: compare` with 'your repository: master'
    - Click on your head repository's `compare` dropdown, and switch branches from your 'main' branch to `<new branch name>`.
    - Finally, click the green `Create Pull Request` button. Great job! You did it!
